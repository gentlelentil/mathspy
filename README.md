Contains mathematical functions I created for use in my thesis/projects.
The design of the functions is to create a more comprehensive use for these mathematical functions.
e.g change_vec_distance will give a series of points along a vector, for iterating over. An example use would be varying the distance between two molecules to identify change in single point energy.
